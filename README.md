# An associative learning account of how infants learn about causal action in animates and inanimates: A critical re-examination of 4 classic studies
This repository contains the modeling files and network data for the simulations reported in Benton (2024, JEPG).

## Overview of the Repository
- <code>Simulation 1a</code>: Simulation of Spelke, Phillips, & Woodward (1995) with an extension to "younger" models.
- <code>Simulation 1b</code>: Simulation addressing a potential objection that an AL mechanism cannot discover causally relevant features.
- <code>Simulation 1c</code>: Simulation addressing a potential objection that Simulation 1a doesn't model "fuzzy" objects or people.
- <code>Simulation 2</code>:  Simulations of Saxe, Tenenbaum, & Carey (2005).
- <code>Simulation 3</code>:  Simulations of Saxe, Tzelnic, & Carey (2007).
- <code>Simulation 4</code>: Simulations of Markson & Spelke (2006).

## Simulation Software

The simulations reported here use a software package called "LENS" (for Light Efficient Network Simulator). LENS runs under both Windows and Unix-based systems (including Linux and OS X). You can download the latest version of the simulator here: <a href="[deon.benton@vanderbilt.edu](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~plaut/Lens/)" target="_blank">https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~plaut/Lens/</a>.
